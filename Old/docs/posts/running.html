<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>
<p>Recently I started reading Murakami's "What I Talk About When I Talk About Running" and I have finished reading the first three chapters so far. In this book, Murakami recounts his running journey right from the beginning which inspires me to write about my own running journey.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Now that I look back at it, its been ten years since I first started running and around five years since I started running regularly. I think we first signed started running to participate in Wipro Marathon 2013 or 2012(I don't remember). To prepare for that race, we participated in Chennai Trail Marathon. I think I ran a 10k in 47 minutes at Chennai Trial Marathon and a half marathon in 2:20 mins at Wipro Marathon. Citing my participation in Wipro Marathon, Appa requested Manoharan Sir to include me in the Athletics team and eventually Felix Sir came to my classroom and asked to me join the practice sessions. In retrospect, I don't think anyone else would have got such an easy entry into the school athletics team.</p>
<p>In our school atheletics team, I was trained to be a long distance runner - 800 and 400 metres. It involved doing a variety of workouts everyday in the morning before school began. But after a year of being in the atheletics team, I left the team on the December of my 8th standard in order to focus more on Table Tennis. So throught my 9th standard I did not run much as I focused only on Table Tennis and leg workouts. I started running again only during the later part(second term) of my 10th standard. At first, I ran 3km everyday in my neighborhood. It was hard and exerting and I had to push myself to finish. But I knew my day felt much better if I had run in the morning. I don't know why but for a long- well into my first few months in 11th standard- time I kept running in this 3km route around my house. Then somewhere around this time I started running upto Marina beach which is a 13km run from my house. After that I started running regularly to and fro Anna nagar roundtana which is a 7km run. It was around this time I truly experienced runners high and got addicted to it.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Amherst for College and continued running every day. In my Freshmen year, I ensured that I ran at least 3miles everyday. I tried to join the Running club here but I could not commit to the club as I was busy with Table Tennis and classes. So for the most part I ran by myself. Even during the harsh winter of New England, I ran almost everyday. Wearing a couple of layers, gloves and tights made running in winter possible. Even though running in the winter is a lot of effort, I actually enjoy running in the winter for some reason.</p>
