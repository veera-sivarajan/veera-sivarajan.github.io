For our final project, Hayden and I are building [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life][Conway's Game of Life]] simulator on a LED matrix. We will also add a controller which the audience can use to pause and play the simulation. With this project, we aim to understand how interesting patterns emerge from a small set of rules. The coordinates for the simulation will be computed on an Arduino board which will be connected to both the simulator and the controller. Along the way, we might also add features that tickles our fancy. Check this page by December, 2021 to view the final product.
