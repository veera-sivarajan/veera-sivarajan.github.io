#+TITLE: About Me
#+DATE: <2022-04-12 Tue>  

I'm Veera (he/him), a computer science student at UMass Amherst. I'm passionate about compilers, programming languages and developer tools. I enjoy rewriting [[https://github.com/veera-sivarajan][tools]] from scratch as it allows me to understand all the layers of abstraction in the system. 

Outside of programming, I love to run long distances or play [[https://youtu.be/I7XNeGwZhj4][Table Tennis]].
* Hire Me
I'm looking for a job involving compilers or developer tools. I currently work as an IOS developer and have experience using Rust and C++ for my personal projects. Here is my [[https://veera.app/imgs/veera-vitae.pdf][curriculum vitae]].
