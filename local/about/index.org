#+TITLE: About Me
#+DATE: <2022-04-12 Tue>  

Hello, I'm Veera (he/him). I study computer science at UMass Amherst. I'm passionate about compilers, programming languages and developer tools. I spend most of my time working on projects that would improve my computing experience. All my projects are open source and can be found on the profile linked above. I also enjoy configuring and using Emacs for a number of day-to-day tasks. 

I love running long distances. It allows me to take a break from sitting in front of a computer and makes me feel calm and composed.  

I also love Table Tennis and have played competitively for several years. 

If you want to reach out, feel free to contact me via email.
