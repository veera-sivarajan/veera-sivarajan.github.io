I'm Veera (he/him), a programmer passionate about compilers, programming languages and developer tools. I enjoy contributing to [[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aveera-sivarajan][middle-end optimizations in LLVM]] and the [[https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aveera-sivarajan][Rust compiler]].
