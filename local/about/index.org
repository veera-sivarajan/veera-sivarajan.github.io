#+TITLE: About Me

Hello, I'm Veera. I study computer science at UMass Amherst. I'm passionate about compilers, programming languages and operating systems. I spend most of my time working on projects that would improve my computing experience. All my projects are open source and can be found on the profile linked above. I also enjoy configuring and using Emacs for a number of day-to-day tasks. 

I love running long distances and have participated in several marathons since 2012. I try to run around five miles everyday even during the cold winters of New England. Over the years, running has become my everyday therapy.

I also love playing Table Tennis and have been trained professionally for the past ten years. These days, I play twice a week to maintain a USATT rating around 2000. Recently, our team at UMass participated in the NCTTA nationals.

If you want to reach out, feel free to contact me via email.
