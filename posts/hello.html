<h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>
<p>After several failed attempts to create a blog, I finally managed to make one by writing a static site generator in Bash based on nerdypepperâ€™s <a href="https://peppe.rs/posts/static_sites_with_bash/">post</a>. To put it simply, the Bash script reads all markdown files from a directory, converts them into HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/installing.html">Pandoc</a>, adds some essential CSS and HTML to all the files and writes all resulting files in a specific directory. I also wrote a small script to add a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Fa%E1%B8%B7">Tirukkural</a> to my homepage whenever I update the blog. This script uses <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> to fetch a kural from a JSON database on my system. Finally, to update the blog, all I have to do is execute <a href="https://github.com/veera-sivarajan/veera-sivarajan.github.io/blob/master/build.sh">build.sh</a> and push all files to remote.</p>
<p>I stole the CSS from <a href="https://ambrevar.xyz/">here</a>. If you are the author of that blog, a big thank you and also I really appreciate your posts about Emacs.</p>
<p>I look forward to writing regulary on this blog.</p>
