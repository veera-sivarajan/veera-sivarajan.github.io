<title>Vim To Emacs</title>
<h1 id="reflections-on-switching-to-emacs-from-vim">Reflections on switching to Emacs from Vim</h1>
<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>
<p>I have to begin this essay with a comment I read on <strong>HackerNews</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a scientific term “umwelt” that biologists use to describe the world as experienced by a particular organism. Every one of us has this “umwelt” - our “subjective view of the world.” Our umwelt is limited by our physical and mental capabilities, past experiences, and social circles we grow up and live. e.g., your subjective understanding of Renaissance Art would drastically differ from when you’re taken to a museum at the age of three, and when you go there as an adult, or after studying art for fifteen years.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Fianally, the author adds few lines about learning Lisp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning and understanding Lisp expands your umwelt. You will start seeing things differently. It doesn’t inevitably make you a better programmer; it might, but doesn’t guarantee it, just like suddenly gaining the ability to see things in the infrared spectrum not guaranteed to make your life better.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>I will first define the terms before I explain why this piece of software written in Lisp is something close to my heart.</p>
