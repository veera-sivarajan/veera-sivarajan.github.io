<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>
<p>Initially, I had no idea about building a blog. I have tried to use a number of static site generators but I never figured how to use them effectively. But after reading NerdyPepperâ€™s <a href="https://peppe.rs/posts/static_sites_with_bash/">post</a>, I realized writing my own static website generator is not complicated.</p>
<h2 id="flowchart">Flowchart</h2>
<p>Essentially, the bash script reads all markdown files from a directory, converts them into HTML using pandoc and finally writes the HTML to a new file in the specified path. I have added some CSS and some HTML for the bells and whistles in this website. Now all I have to do to update my blog is run a shell script which I plan to automate using <code>cron</code>.</p>
<h2 id="todo">TODO</h2>
<p>This website requires some design tweaking. But overall I really like the way this website looks and feels.</p>
