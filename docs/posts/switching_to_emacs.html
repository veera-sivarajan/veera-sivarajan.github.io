<title>Switching To Emacs</title>

<blockquote>
<p>There's a scientific term "umwelt" that biologists use to describe the world as experienced by a particular organism. Every one of us has this "umwelt" - our "subjective view of the world." Our umwelt is limited by our physical and mental capabilities, past experiences, and social circles we grow up and live. e.g., your subjective understanding of Renaissance Art would drastically differ from when you're taken to a museum at the age of three, and when you go there as an adult, or after studying art for fifteen years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learning and understanding Lisp expands your umwelt. You will start seeing things differently. It doesn't inevitably make you a better programmer; it might, but doesn't guarantee it, just like suddenly gaining the ability to see things in the infrared spectrum not guaranteed to make your life better.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It was the summer of 2020 and I had just completed a course in Data Structures. Armded With new ideas and wisdom, I was passionately implementing various algorithms and data structures in Java. Beneath the boy who just started writing real programs there lied an irresistible desire to learn and explore the world of Emacs. And when I started playing with Haskell and Lisp, I knew it was time to take the plunge and switch to Emacs.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-emacs">Configuring Emacs</h2>
<p>I fondly recollect the first few days of using Emacs. It was filled with wonder and exhilaration as I felt like a kid entering Disney World for the first time. By watching a couple of Youtube videos and by copy-pasting code snippets from Stack Overflow, I was able to configure it just enough to start editing files. Even though I had barely scratched the surface of Elisp programming, the possibilites seemed limitless and inspiring.</p>
<p>This limitless possibility to customize made me develop a personal connection with Emacs. At this point, I consider my Emacs like a pet I own. At this point, every keybinding, mode and theme I use has been adjusted to my preference and I'm quite proud that my Emacs is one of a kind in the world.</p>
<pre class="elisp"><code>;; My first elisp function written on my own - August 29
(defun switch-window-down-evil-normal()
  (interactive)
  (evil-normal-state)
  (evil-window-down 1))
</code></pre>
<h2 id="why-i-love-emacs">Why I Love Emacs</h2>
<h3 id="programmability">Programmability</h3>
<p>Using Emacs was my first exposure to a programmable environment. By looking at how various packages that I use are implemented, I got to read and understand programs that people actually use. As a CompSci student, I always felt that there is a huge divide between the programs I write in school and the real programs that I use everyday. But inside Emacs, the source code for every feature is easily accessible. If I do not like the behavior of a package, I can easily dive into the source code and modify it.</p>
<h3 id="org-mode">Org Mode</h3>
<p>Org mode enabled me to do all my word processing inside Emacs. I remember having to use Google Docs for my academic works with great resentment but after getting the hang of Org, I do all my essay writing, blog writing, school homework inside Emacs. I also use it for keeping track of homework deadlines and for writng README files. It is such a luxury to have one environment that can do all sorts of text editing.</p>
<h3 id="lisp-and-haskell-support">Lisp and Haskell Support</h3>
<p>I have never experienced anything as effortless as writing Lisp programs in Emacs. Since Emacs was written in a Lisp, there is no doubt that it has the best support for Lisp programming. I can evaluate a sexp, check the results and get back to editing the file all without taking my hands off keyboard. Emacs allows a lot of flexibility in interpreting Lisp code. From evaluating a sexp to evaluating a certain part of the buffer, I have infinite flexibility for interpreting Lisp code.</p>

<p>Using Emacs has a profound impact on the way I think. It shapes the way I think about my own projects' design and implementation. In an abstract sense, as the configurations get more personalized, my Emacs evolves along with me. I strongle believe that the lessons I learn by using Emacs are highly invaluable. I will be eternally grateful to the creators and developers of Emacs for that.</p>
