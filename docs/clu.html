In the 1970s, Barbara Liskov, along with her graduate students, Eliot Moss and others created the CLU programming language. Its ideas has been adopted in every programming language we use today.

<p>
Luckily, I got to take a compilers class with Prof. Eliot Moss last Spring and ask him about his experience working on the design and implementation of the language. The following was his response:
</p>

<p class="verse">
Hello, Veera!<br>
<br>
&gt; I came across the CLU programming language when researching about how<br>
&gt; iterators came into being and was excited to see that you have contributed<br>
&gt; to the design and implementation of CLU.<br>
<br>
Yes, though I came on somewhat in the middle of the language design effort.<br>
<br>
&gt; Can you please tell me about your experience working on the language? And<br>
&gt; how do you feel about it now that CLU&rsquo;s ideas are adopted in almost every<br>
&gt; modern programming language?<br>
<br>
Prior to working on Clu I had coded in Basic, Fortran, Lisp, and C.  The key<br>
innovation of Clu was its emphasis on <b>abstract data types</b>, which wrapped<br>
together (into a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;, hence the name Clu) a data structure definition<br>
and operations on that data structure into a higher level thing.<br>
Object-orientation is similar in that you can have private parts of your data<br>
structure and then write methods.  What OO languages add to what Clu did is<br>
inheritance / extension of one type by another.  (Clu did have a nice system<br>
of <b>parameterized</b> types, similar to Java&rsquo;s type parameters.)<br>
<br>
Another nice thing Clu had was a way to extend the builtin operators, like +,<br>
to any data type - we called that &ldquo;syntactic sugar&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s a bit like what you<br>
can do in C++, minus the complicated overloading.<br>
<br>
Coming back to what you led with: iterators.  We realized that people do like<br>
to iterate over organized collections of things, and also that if we did <b>not</b><br>
provide something like iterators then data abstraction would not be so nice<br>
since people would tend to expose internal data structure to support the<br>
iteration.  Clu&rsquo;s iterators are as easy to <b>use</b> as those of Java, but much<br>
easier to <b>write</b> because of the yield statement.  In Java, you have to come<br>
up with a way of representing the state of the iteration explicitly, while in<br>
Clu it is implicit in the local variables, etc., of the running iterator.  It<br>
did require a more co-routine / lambda function kind of implementation (the<br>
caller of an iterator has to provide a place for the iterator to &ldquo;call&rdquo; back<br>
into the loop body).<br>
<br>
Clu was also a garbage collected language - I wrote the first garbage<br>
collector for it (in assembly language, no less!).  Storage management errors,<br>
and just the general mess of tracking your storage, makes it harder to write<br>
programs.  In Clu, many of us had the novel experience of having a program<br>
work the first time it compiled (!).  Clu&rsquo;s nice collection of builtin types<br>
and the functions provided for them also made many things easier to code, an<br>
example being strings.  (This was part where I took the design lead, as I<br>
recall.)<br>
<br>
Overall, it was quite an elegant language, if I say so myself.  And for<br>
someone who works in the PL area, having a grad school experience of being on<br>
a good language design and implementation team was great!  I am grateful to<br>
all of them, and of course our advisor and group leader, Barbara Liskov.<br>
<br>
Cheers - E<br>
